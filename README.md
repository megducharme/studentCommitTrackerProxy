## Student Tracker Proxy Server
----
This server is used to call GitHub's API with basic auth to get the most recent commit of the students in my class. GitHub's API allows 60 calls/hour without auth, and 5000 with auth. 

To use the server, set up two environmental variables with your GitHub username and password, clone and enjoy up to 5000 GitHub API calls!
